How were these aims achieved by 1890?', 20, '- Bismarck\'s primary aim was to secure Germany\'s position in Europe following its unification in 1871. He sought to maintain peace in Europe to allow the newly-formed German Empire to consolidate its power. His goals included isolating France to prevent revenge after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and preventing any alliance between France and other major powers such as Russia and Austria-Hungary. He achieved this through several alliances and treaties, such as the League of the Three Emperors (with Russia and Austria-Hungary), the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary in 1879, and the Triple Alliance in 1882 with Italy. These diplomatic efforts kept Germany at the center of European politics while neutralizing France\'s potential allies.

Furthermore, there was limited knowledge about the interior of Africa, and the economic potential was not yet fully realized. European countries were primarily focused on colonizing the Americas and Asia. However, in the latter half of the 19th century, factors like the Industrial Revolution created a demand for raw materials such as rubber, cotton, and minerals, which Africa could supply. Additionally, the \'Scramble for Africa\' was fueled by European powers\' desire to secure new markets for their manufactured goods, acquire strategic naval bases, and establish national prestige through territorial expansion. The spread of missionary activity and European superiority ideologies, such as the notion of the \'White Man\'s Burden,\' further justified colonization. These factors culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, where European nations formalized their claims over African territories.', 'This response thoroughly explains the shift in European priorities from neglect to intense competition for African colonies, integrating economic, political, and cultural factors.', NULL, NULL, NULL),
(302, 10, 'essay', 'Explain Britain\'s position concerning European affairs in the years before 1900. Why did Britain shift from this position before 1914?', 20, '- Before 1900, Britain maintained a policy of \'splendid isolation,\' meaning it avoided permanent alliances with European powers. The main reason for this was that Britain\'s empire and global trade interests meant it was more concerned with overseas territories rather than continental politics. Britain relied on its strong navy to protect its trade routes and empire, rather than military alliances.

Mussolini capitalized on the fear of socialism and the failure of the democratic government to address issues like unemployment and inflation. He formed the Fascist Party in 1919, promising to restore order and national pride. In 1922, Mussolini staged the \'March on Rome,\' and King Victor Emmanuel III invited him to form a government. Once in power, Mussolini established a dictatorship by dismantling democratic institutions and suppressing political opposition. Domestically, he focused on modernizing Italy‚Äôs economy through state intervention in industries and infrastructure projects like roads and schools. However, he failed to resolve Italy‚Äôs deep economic problems, and his aggressive foreign policies, particularly his alliance with Hitler during World War II, led to his downfall.

His skepticism makes him a target for ridicule, especially by Jack and his followers.\n\nSimon takes a more philosophical approach to the beast. He recognizes that the beast is not a physical entity but a symbol of the darkness within each of the boys.

Mugo‚Äôs prophecy becomes a guiding force for the people of the ridges, as they interpret it as a divine message foretelling the arrival of someone who will save them from their divisions.\n\nMugo is portrayed as a mysterious and wise figure, respected for his spiritual insight. His contribution to the plot lies in his ability to stir the imagination of the people and give them hope for unity. His prophecy creates tension in the novel, as the characters struggle with whether Waiyaki, the protagonist, is the leader Mugo predicted. This uncertainty drives much of the conflict in the story, as both ridges look to Waiyaki to fulfill the prophecy.\n\nMugo wa Kabiro‚Äôs role is symbolic; he represents the possibility of unity between the conflicting forces of tradition and modernity. His prophecy serves as a thread that connects the themes of the novel, including the clash between colonial influence and traditional African values, and the hope for reconciliation and progress. While he does not play an active role in the plot, his prophecy sets the stage for the events that unfold and gives Waiyaki his purpose.', 'Mugo wa Kabiro is a symbolic prophet whose prophecy about unity drives the plot, influencing Waiyaki\'s actions and the expectations of the people on both ridges.', NULL, NULL, NULL),

The two ridges represent two different ideologies and ways of life. Kameno is portrayed as the stronghold of traditional values, where the people are deeply connected to their customs, particularly the practice of circumcision and the worship of ancestral spirits. The inhabitants of Kameno are resistant to the influence of the white missionaries and see the preservation of their cultural heritage as essential to their survival.\n\nIn contrast, Makuyu represents the embrace of Western influence, particularly Christianity. The people of Makuyu, led by Joshua, have converted to Christianity and reject the traditional practices of Kameno. Joshua‚Äôs zealous opposition to circumcision, a key cultural practice, and his strict adherence to Christian doctrines create a rift between the two ridges. Makuyu becomes the center of the new faith, drawing in those who are willing to forsake their traditions for the promises of Western religion and education.\n\nThe conflict between Kameno and Makuyu is more than just a geographical rivalry; it is a battle for the soul of the community. Both ridges are vying for leadership and influence, with Kameno clinging to the past and Makuyu looking to the future through Westernization. This struggle for leadership manifests in the characters\' actions, particularly in Waiyaki, who tries to bridge the gap between the two ridges by advocating for education while still respecting tradition.
